# Workshop Tour - Zagreb - Ljubljana

## Description 

Finally another build and code Workshop-Tour for making the famous 8Bit Mixtape NEO is happening in Zagren and Ljubljana! Join us for a weekend of soldering and experimenting with lo-fi 8Bit soundzzz and bluuurrrps.

The 8Bit Mixtape NEO is a lo-fi 8Bit synthesizer based on the Arduino-compatible ATTINY85, featuring 2 Pots, 2 Buttons and 8 addressable RGB Neo-pixels. The key feature of the new 8Bit Mixtape NEO is the easiness of uploading new codes using an audio communication protocol.

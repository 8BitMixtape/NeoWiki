# Workshop Tour - Zagreb - Ljubljana

## Description 

Finally another build and code Workshop-Tour for making the famous 8Bit Mixtape NEO is happening in Zagreb and Ljubljana! Join us for a session of soldering and experimenting with lo-fi 8Bit soundzzz and bluuurrrps.

The 8Bit Mixtape NEO is a lo-fi 8Bit synthesizer based on the Arduino-compatible ATTINY85, featuring 2 Pots, 2 Buttons and 8 addressable RGB Neo-pixels. The key feature of the new 8Bit Mixtape NEO is the easiness of uploading new codes using an audio communication protocol.

The 8Bit Mixtape NEO has been developed since Winter 2017 by dusjagr, ChrisMicro (RoboterClub Freiburg), Budi Prakosa (Lifepatch) and many other contributors! Since December 2018 it's ready for sale on our new website

i designed this new board, mostly an interface, in reference to [Erkki Kurenniemi](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Unwriting-Media-Art-History/dp/0262029588/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1489690142&sr=1-1&keywords=Erkki%20Kurenniemi%20in%202048).

[Erkki Kurenniemi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erkki_Kurenniemi) (born July 10, 1941 in HÃ¤meenlinna, Finland) is a Finnish designer, philosopher and artist, best known for his electronic music compositions and the electronic instruments he has designed.

Other people have already done some ["re-makes"](http://www.tasankokaiku.com/jarisuominen/dimi-is-reborn/).

And when dusjagr saw one in Helsinki... he was impressed!

## What is it?

Also based on the same layout and pin use like the 8Bit Mixtape. This can be implemented on a 15x10 cm board and then assembled into a laser cut box, including a speaker (using the PAM8302?).

Still need to figure out how to connect it...

* A1: via 8 resistors different voltage division
* A2: same but on different ADC
* B1: maybe via 4 resitor to the same as SD-prog?
* B2: even more on SD-Prog?
* X1: maybe we just don't use this :-)

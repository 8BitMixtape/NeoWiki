### Overview

During the NeoCoco Workshop the participants will learn how to solder SMD (surface mount devices) and build the complete circuitboard of the little synthesizer.

[NeoCocoCat](https://kitnic.it/boards/github.com/kimitobo/neocococat/) is a board variation from the [8Bitmixtape-NEO](https://github.com/8BitMixtape) circuit and board. 8Bitmixtape is a DIY sound synthesizer electronic circuit using the inexpensive and Arduino compatible Attiny85 chip, few very basic components and easy-to-use [code uploader using audio jack](https://github.com/ChrisMicro/TinyAudioBoot) instead of a USB interface.

### Schedule

**Saturday 11 - 14h**

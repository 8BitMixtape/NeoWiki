#### Renamed to 8Bit Mixtape NEO / Formerly known as 8bitMixTape-SoundProg2085

New Attiny85 based edition with Bootloader to program it via sound

Inspired by the bootloader for atmega by Christoph Haberer and other implementations by Fredrik...

Not found anything yet for attiny, except that's it's a bit more challenging to make bootloaders.

Can we maybe use the same bootloader to program via blinking lights?

# Bootloader in progress

see devel repo here:

* Iyoks devel: [https://github.com/ATtinyTeenageRiot/TinyAudioBoot](https://github.com/ATtinyTeenageRiot/TinyAudioBoot)
* forked and improved by Chris: [https://github.com/ChrisMicro/TinyAudioBoot](https://github.com/ChrisMicro/TinyAudioBoot)

# Uses of this AudioProg-Bootloader

## For the tape

If we get an online platform many more people will be abel to re-program their tapes and share their codes on the web.

## General Attiny Educational Platform

* FreiBots low-cost minimal
* Coconuts
